### About Hanzai: 
Hanzai is a mobile application for learning the Chinese language (especially reading/writing Chinese) using Python, JavaScript, and Flutter. This project was conducted under the guidance of [Dr. Jawad Ashraf](https://www.kust.edu.pk/kust/index.php/fcomp/285-dr-jawad-ashraf) at KUST Kohat. Throughout the project, Dr. Ashraf provided invaluable assistance in tackling diverse subjects, including Model Training, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the selection of SDKs and frameworks. The implementation and validation of the Chinese language aspect were reviewed by [Lecturer. Safdar Hussain](https://www.numl.edu.pk/faculty/203) at NUML Islamabad.

### Note! 
In the assets folder **audios/hanzi/** there are two zip files you need to unzip them in order for the character sounds to work properly. The reason why they're zipped is because there are more than 1000+ audio clips. One more thing the **char_f.zip** is functional as it contains all the audio clips and the male version is still in process.
