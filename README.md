### About Hanzai: 
Hanzai (Mobile Application) is all about making Chinese learning more accessible and feasible to an average user especially it's reading and writing part. The technology used in the making of Hanzai App is Python, JavaScript, and Flutter(Mostly). This project was conducted under the guidance of [Dr. Jawad Ashraf](https://www.kust.edu.pk/kust/index.php/fcomp/285-dr-jawad-ashraf) at KUST Kohat.

### Note! 
In the assets folder **audios/hanzi/** there are two zip files you need to unzip them in order for the character sounds to work properly. The reason why they're zipped is because there are more than 1000+ audio clips. One more thing the **char_f.zip** is functional as it contains all the audio clips and the male version is still in process.
